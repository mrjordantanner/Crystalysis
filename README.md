# Crystalysis

![7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50030252/162596969-368abf7f-f016-4c5e-b99f-a041ba8f7099.png)

This place has fallen victim to a strange corruption.  Toxic crystals, like tumors, grow endlessly upward out of the ground, emanating a malevolent force that poisons and paralyzes everything around them.  Trapped within them is the life force of the planet itself, slowly being stolen away.  Stranded here, you must destroy as many crystals as you can, salvaging the life force within to recharge your energy, but only delaying your inevitable doom.

**How to Play**

Run, jump, and dash your way around the area and smash any crystals you find.  As time passes they will spawn and grow stronger more rapidly.  Some destroyed crystals will emit healing shards that will seek you out and recharge your energy.  Last as long as you can.

**Controls**

Using a gamepad is encouraged, but if you don't have one, use these:

Move - [ WASD ]

Punch - [ K ]

Jump - [ Space ] (hold for higher jump)

Dash - [ L ] (can also dash in air)

Pause - [ M ]

Restart - [ R ]

Quit - [ Esc ]




**Known Bugs**

- If you fall off the edge of the map, use R to restart.  The "safety net" is buggy.
- After dying or restarting, the dash ability will only work if you press the dash button without any directional buttons pressed.  Strange bug that I'm working on fixing.

â€‹**Fixed Bugs**

These files were updated after Ludum Dare ended in order to fix a few game breaking bugs which were:

- Game not resetting properly after player death.
- Crystal spawner timer would suddenly be set to 0 and the map would instantly be maxed out on crystals.  Not cool.
